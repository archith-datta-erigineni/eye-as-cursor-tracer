# eye-as-cursor-tracer
Python Program Mapping Cursor to Where Eye is Looking

This program uses computer vision to predict where a user's eyes are looking on the screen. While running, the program will move the cursor to where the eye is roughly looking towards. Left wink does a left click and right wink does a right click.
